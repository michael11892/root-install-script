# root-install-script
Installation Script for CERN's ROOT Packet

Simply execute the script as superuser and the rest should be done automatically

The script will download the .rpm for cmake (repository version is too outdated to properly build ROOT) <br>
cmake will place its install directory wherever the script is run so keep that in mind before choosing where to execute the script
